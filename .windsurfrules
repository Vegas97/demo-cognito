GUIDELINE[code_quality]:After making any code changes, automatically run the check script (npm run check) to verify both linting and TypeScript type checking pass without errors. Report any issues found and offer to fix them. if scripts are not present add them.
("lint": "next lint",)
("typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",)
("check": "npm run lint || true && npm run typecheck")

list of commands that you can run automatically:
npm run check
npm run lint
npm run typecheck

if you think that some commands should be added into the automatic one, ask me to add them in the memory or ask/suggest me to add in the config manually.
